# world-shaping
Wherein I shall endeavor to ascertain the wherefors and whythehecks of world generation datapacks for minecraft, with an end goal of creating better resource worlds for Titancraft.

Nothing here is guaranteed to work, or be at all useful for others.  It is solely for my own amusement, though torture seems more likely.  Gotta love trying to ascertain what a particular parameter is actually DOING. 

If you choose to use this, it is at your own risk, though most likely the generation will not work, or work oddly.  As you cannot comment in a json file there will be a separate doc with my notes.  I have not created said doc yet, and may forget to modify this Readme with the doc name when I get around to it.
